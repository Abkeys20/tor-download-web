Thank you, Remco.

We're seeking to create a script which allows each instance of the download site to be turned into a mirror. Ideally, someone can use git clone, run setup.sh, and have a working download mirror fully configured.

setup.sh should:
1. Pull the contents of Torâ€™s website mirror (or even just dist/torbrowser if possible, since that's all we need)

2. Check the GPG keys to make sure that nothing has been modified

3. Move the download files into a mirror directory and update the URLs found in thank-you.js

4. Ensure that the mirror and the git repo will auto update using cron and will work across version numbers

The current script in the repository has a rough sketch of what I was going for.

Thanks for your help! Open up a pull request whenever you're ready. Feel free to ask us if you have any questions.
